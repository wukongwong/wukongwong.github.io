## "Make a difference."

Hello, I am Shuaijun Wang, currently leading a Dexterous Manipulation team in the Robotics Department at Xiaomi Technology. I earned my Ph.D. from the Robotics Institute, National Key Laboratory of Harbin Institute of Technology, under the guidance of Professor Lining Sun. Before this, I earned my master's and bachelor's degrees from Harbin Institute of Technology and Northeast Forestry University, respectively.

Between 2019 and 2021, I conducted research as a visiting scholar at the School of Informatics Robotics Center of the University of Edinburgh, working with Dr. Alex Li. From March 2022 to December 2022, I collaborated remotely with Professor Qiang Li at the Robotics Center of the University of Bielefeld in Germany. In 2022-2023, I worked as a research intern at Tencent Robotics X Laboratory.

My research focuses on universal grasping and manipulation of humanoid robots, as well as embodied AI. At Xiaomi, I lead a team of 10 researchers developing dexterous manipulation algorithms using imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks. My research has been published in top robotics journals including IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics.

### Research Interests
- Dexterous Manipulation and Grasping
