Hello, I am Shuaijun Wang, currently leading a **Dexterous Manipulation team** in the Robotics Department at **Xiaomi Technology**. I earned my Ph.D. from the Robotics Institute, National Key Laboratory of Harbin Institute of Technology, under the guidance of Professor Sun Lining. Before this, I earned my master's and bachelor's degrees from Harbin Institute of Technology and Northeast Forestry University, respectively.

Between 2019 and 2021, I conducted research as a visiting scholar at the School of Informatics Robotics Center of the **University of Edinburgh**. During this period, I was working with Professor Alex Li. From March 2022 to December 2022, I collaborated remotely with Professor Li Qiang at the Robotics Center of the **University of Bielefeld** in Germany. In 2022-2023, I worked as a research intern at **Tencent Robotics X Laboratory**.

My research focuses on the **universal grasping and manipulation of humanoid robots**, as well as **embodied AI**.

> *"Make a difference."* - This is my motto.
